# Methodology-for-Outliers-Detection
The present study presents the different methods and techniques for analyzing one of the basic steps before running the models - the detection of outliers and anomalies. 

Economics as a science of scarcity, places the necessity of studying the economic system in the direction of increasing its efficiency. More and more models close to "reality" are being created that make it possible to understand and predict economic dynamics in order to create effective and responsive economic and social public policies. An important factor in this direction is that all steps from the correct measurement of economic phenomena, to the correct collection of the data, cleaning and preparation of the data are optimal. Only then the models that step on this data will be correct and give the right answers.

The present study presents the different methods and techniques for analyzing one of the basic steps before running the models - the detection of outliers and anomalies. The theory of "end values", their types, the factors behind their occurrence and the meaning behind each "end value" will be briefly presented.

The purpose of the study is not to show which of these "end values" are bad, wrong or unnecessary, but rather to show different approaches to distinguishing them, which will provide the necessary information for the next step in dealing with them.

As an example of analysis, the database of the World Bank will be used, and specifically indicators for the level of employment and unemployment.
